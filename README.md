# Global-Use-of-Sactions

This research project set out to answer three main questions:
1) How has the use of sanctions changed over time?
2) What is the distribution of countries that have sanctioned others and countries that have been sanctioned?
3) What are the most frequent objectives and types of sanctions?

Through a variety of ggplot graphs, we found that the United States places the most sanctions by far. Most sanctions are placed from wealthier countries onto lower-income countries. Finally, human rights and democracy-related reasons seem to be the most prominent claims for a sanction to be placed.
