# Global Use of Sactions
### by Shray Dewan and Tristan Serr

This research project set out to answer three main questions:
1. How has the use of sanctions changed over time?
2. What is the distribution of countries that have sanctioned others and countries that have been sanctioned?
3. What are the most frequent objectives of sanctions?

## 1. Sanctions over Time

## Conclusions

From our dataset and subsequent visualizations, we conclude that sanctions are the tool of the privileged, and said tool has been used to transcend traditional, and domestically unpopular, methods of coercion and subjugation by developed economies. Our time series plots show that the use of sanctions increased during the postwar era, during the 1980s, and again in the 21st century, demonstrating the use of sanctions as a direct substitute for unpopular war (such as World War II or the War in Afghanistan) and as an instrument for more interventionist administration (such as the Reagan administration).  Our choropleths visualize the more developed, Western nations and organizations (such as the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, Canada, Norway, etc.) as greater users of sanctions while nations that are often the target of said sanctions (such as Russia, Iran, Libya, Venezuela, etc.) are unable to retaliate, perhaps due to their more limited economies.  We know that sanctions are an economically burdensome policy toll for both countries involved, and a country must be able to internally tolerate the disruption that a lack of trade or finances will cause.
